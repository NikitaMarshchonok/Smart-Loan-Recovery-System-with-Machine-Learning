A compact, end‑to‑end notebook that demonstrates how to:
1) explore loan & borrower data,  
2) segment borrowers with **K‑Means**,  
3) predict **default/recovery risk** with a **Random Forest**, and  
4) **assign the optimal recovery strategy** (legal action / settlement / reminders) based on the predicted risk.

This project is ideal as a portfolio piece: it shows business framing, data analysis, unsupervised segmentation, supervised risk modeling, and an actionable decision layer.
